title: The Making of a Digital Beehive
---
This website will detail my attempt to make an affordable internet connected beehive. The beehive will be internet connected in that it will be constantly uploaded data to the internet about the health of the hive. Currently, the three key measurements that I would like to know are weight and weight change, inside temperature, and outside temperature. I believe that these three pieces of information will help me to become a better beekeeper and notice trends with my hives over time. 


All of my methods, diagrams, and source code will be kept in the [tmrudick/hive-scale](http://github.com/tmrudick/hive-scale) repository for others to share, build, and expand on my initial ideas.
